# Next.js CAPTCHA Project

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app). It includes a vibrant, animated CAPTCHA challenge where users must select all images containing dogs from a mix of dogs and muffins.

## 🧠 CAPTCHA Component

The CAPTCHA component presents 9 images (randomly selected dogs and muffins) and asks users to **"Select all dogs"**. Once verified, it shows feedback based on the correctness of the selection.

### Features

- 🎲 Randomized images on each load
- ✨ Animated selection highlight
- 🎯 Smooth transitions and hover effects
- 🖼️ Compact and responsive design
- 🎨 Styled using vibrant CSS themes

## 🚀 Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
````

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.


## 🧩 Optimized Fonts

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
